# Setseer

Setseer is a simple Mandelbrot/Julia set renderer written in order to
allow its author to get more used to Haskell. It is not very interesting
and might be horribly written due to the inexperience of the author.
Regardless of its potential awfulness it will create beautiful pictures
for you when given the right parameters.
